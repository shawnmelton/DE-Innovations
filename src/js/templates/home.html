        <p>Adding an idea board would provide a location for employees to talk about the big challenges that our companies are trying to overcome.  Pulling in innovative, creative thinking during lunch breaks (or early mornings) would allow companies to benefit from thought leaders that are typically unavailable when companies work in their own siloes.</p>

Hackathon winners could receive an additional week, two weeks or a month based on the merit of their efforts.  Companies would reap the rewards of seeing their employee's ideas become reality.</p>
